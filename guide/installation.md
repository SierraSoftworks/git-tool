# Installation

## Downloading Git-Tool

We publish the latest Git-Tool releases on \[GitHub\]\[release\] for all of our supported platforms. Head on over and download the executable for your platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Windows** users on 64-bit platforms should download `git-tool-windows-amd64.exe`.
* **Linux** users on x86\_64 platforms should download `git-tool-linux-amd64` while those on ARM64 platforms should download `git-tool-linux-arm64`.
* **Mac OS** users on Intel platforms should download `git-tool-darwin-amd64` while those on Apple Silicon should download `git-tool-darwin-arm64`.
{% endhint %}

Once you have downloaded the latest Git-Tool executable, rename it to `git-tool` and place it in a directory which is on your `$PATH`. On Linux and Mac OS machines, you may need to use `chmod +x git-tool` to mark the program as executable.

### Using Cargo

If you'd prefer, or if we don't \(yet\) provide pre-built releases for your platform, you can build Git-Tool yourself using `cargo`. Note that you'll need to have [rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for this to work.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Git-Tool depends on `libdbus` to integrate with the keychain on common Linux distros. If you do not have a system keychain, or cannot get a version of `libdbus` and `libdbus-dev` for your platform, you can build Git-Tool with `--no-default-features` to disable keychain support.

With keychain support disabled, the [`gt auth`](../commands/config.md#auth) command will no longer be available and the [`create_remote`](../config/features.md#create_remote) feature will be disabled.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/git-tool.git
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux \(with Keychain\)" %}
```bash
# Install libdbus-1-3 and libdbus-1-dev
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libdbus-1-dev libdbus-1-3
cargo install --git https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/git-tool.git
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux \(without Keychain\)" %}
```bash
# If your platform doesn't support dbus or the Linux Keychain
# you can disable the auth feature
cargo install --git https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/git-tool.git --no-default-features
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mac OS" %}
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/git-tool.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Setting up your `PATH`

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't put your download folder on your `$PATH` - it's probably not a good idea from a security perspective. Instead, find a different directory to store `git-tool` in, I personally use a dedicated **Programs** folder which is used for exactly these kinds of tools.
{% endhint %}

### Windows

To add or modify environment variables on Windows, you can press Win+Pause and then choose **Advanced System Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**. This will open the Environment Variables editor.

There are two changes you'll want to make:

1. Find the `Path` environment variable and edit it, adding the directory you saved Git-Tool into as the bottom of this list.
2. Add a new environment variable called `GITTOOL_CONFIG` and set it to `%USERPROFILE%\git-tool.yml` \(or another location if you'd prefer\).

When you're done, save your changes by clicking on **Ok**.

### Linux

The easiest way to modify your `PATH` on Linux is to open up your `~/.profile` file and add the following \(fill in the path to the directory you placed `git-tool` into earlier\):

```bash
# ~/.profile

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/apps" # Add ~/apps to your path
export GITTOOL_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/git-tool.yml" # Set ~/.config/git-tool.yml as your config
```

### Mac OS

The easiest way to ensure that a program is on your path in Mac OS is to simply drag and drop it into your **Applications** folder. To setup the `GITTOOL_CONFIG` path, open up your `.bash_profile` file using `vi ~/.bash_profile` and add the following.

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile

# If you prefer to keep git-tool in a different folder, you can update your PATH
# export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/apps"

export GITTOOL_CONFIG="$HOME/Library/Preferences/git-tool.yml"
```

## Checkpoint \#1

You should now be able to run `git-tool --version` and see something similar to the following appear in your terminal.

```text
Git-Tool v2.2.0
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you instead get an error saying that `git-tool` could not be found, that means that it is either not on your path or not marked as executable. First try restarting your terminal to make sure you've got the latest `$PATH` loaded and if that doesn't help, head on back to the [Setting up your PATH](installation.md#setting-up-your-path) section and check that you haven't missed anything.
{% endhint %}

## Setup your Config

Now that you can run Git-Tool, the next step is to configure it. If you've followed the steps up to now, you will have a `$GITTOOL_CONFIG` environment variable set. That means we can quickly open up your favourite editor and start getting things configured.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows \(PowerShell\)" %}
```bash
notepad $env:GITTOOL_CONFIG
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows \(cmd\)" %}
```bash
notepad %GITTOOL_CONFIG%
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
```bash
vi $GITTOOL_CONFIG
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mac OS" %}
```bash
vi $GITTOOL_CONFIG
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Drop in the following starter configuration and change the `directory` to point wherever you'd like to keep your repositories.

```yaml
---
directory: "C:\\dev" # CHANGE ME
services:
  - domain: github.com
    website: "https://{{ .Service.Domain }}/{{ .Repo.FullName }}"
    httpUrl: "https://{{ .Service.Domain }}/{{ .Repo.FullName }}.git"
    gitUrl: "git@{{ .Service.Domain }}:{{ .Repo.FullName }}.git"
    default: true
    pattern: "*/*"
apps:
  - name: shell
    command: powershell

features:
  #  Set this to false if you don't want to send crash information to us
  telemetry: true
```

## Checkpoint \#2

Now that you've got your config added, let's make sure that `git-tool` can find it. Run the following command and make sure that it prints out the same config you just saved.

```text
git-tool config
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the config doesn't look like the one you just added, that means Git-Tool couldn't find it. Make sure that you have configured the `$GITTOOL_CONFIG` environment variable to match the path to the file and that it is readable.
{% endhint %}

## Setting up your Shell

The last step in setting up Git-Tool is to configure your shell to support autocompletion and add the `gt` alias.

### PowerShell

To get the most out of Git-Tool \(including adding the `gt` alias\), you'll need to make changes to your PowerShell profile, which is run whenever you start a new command prompt.

In an existing PowerShell terminal, open your profile file for modification using `notepad $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` or `vi $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` and add the following to it:

```text
# Open this file with:
# notepad $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts

# This adds an alias for Git-Tool so you can simply type "gt"
New-Alias -Name gt -Value git-tool

# This sets up autocomplete support for git-tool and "gt"
Invoke-Expression (&git-tool shell-init powershell)
```

### bash

To get the most out of Git-Tool \(including adding the `gt` alias\), you'll need to make changes to your `bash` profile, which is run whenever you start a new terminal session.

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

alias gt="git-tool"
eval "$(git-tool shell-init bash)"
```

### zsh

To get the most out of Git-Tool \(including adding the `gt` alias\), you'll need to make changes to your `zsh` profile, which is run whenever you start a new terminal session.

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
alias gt="git-tool"
eval "$(git-tool shell-init zsh)"
```

### fish

To get the most out of Git-Tool \(including adding the `gt` alias\), you'll need to make changes to your fish config, which is run whenever you start a new terminal session.

```bash
# ~/config.fish
alias gt="git-tool"
complete -f -c git-tool -a "(git-tool complete)"
```

## Checkpoint \#3

You should now be fully set up. Restart your terminal to load the newest version of your profile and try running `gt --version`, you should see something similar to this appear. If you do, **Congratulations**, you're all set up! ðŸš€ 

```text
Git-Tool v2.2.0
